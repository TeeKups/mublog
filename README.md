# ÂµBlog

A minimalistic blogging platform

## How to use
Write your blogs under a blog-directory. 
This is by default `blogs`.
Apply styles in styles.css.

You can configure the blog-directory and blog name in `config.yaml`.

Finally, run `update.py` to generate `index.html`,
which you can then serve on your favorite web server!
